This is a basic game inspired from Chrome's dino. Its made from html css and vanilla javascript.
took me 3 hours in total to think plan and develop the game. There can be some bugs as it's a quick project
and not tested much. I realise that alot of things like hit animation ,sounds etc are missing and maybe i will
add it later. The hardest Part to develop was the logic for collison detection as vanilla JS is not
suitable to develop games and hence does not comes with prebuild features like this, unlike unity.
All the assets are downloaded from multiple websites and i don't own any of them. I also realise that its better
to have seperate folders for assets, stylesheets and scripts but as i said it is just a fun little project
some best practices like this was ignored. Thanks for reading.
